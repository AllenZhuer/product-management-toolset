# Product Management Document Templates

This directory contains a series of product management document templates that can be used for product planning, requirement management, product analysis, and product launch. These templates are inspired by documentation practices similar to those used at companies like Feishu (飞书) and combined with real-world product management experience, designed to help product managers complete documentation work more efficiently.

## Template List

### 1. Product Requirements Document (PRD_Template_EN.md)

The Product Requirements Document is a comprehensive document that details product features, user experience, and technical requirements. It includes product background, user analysis, feature details, interface design, technical requirements, and more, serving as the foundation document for product development. The template follows industry standards with sections for user stories, functional and non-functional requirements, implementation plans, and analytics.

**Applicable Scenarios**: New product development, major feature iterations, product restructuring

### 2. Product Requirement Review Document (Product_Requirement_Review_Template.md)

This template is designed for organizing and recording requirement review meetings, ensuring that product requirements are thoroughly discussed and validated. It adopts a hierarchical numbering structure (I, II, III...) and includes requirement background and value analysis, requirement objectives and effect estimation, requirement scope, requirement description, technical assessment, and more.

**Applicable Scenarios**: Requirement review meetings, cross-team collaboration, requirement confirmation

### 3. Product Analysis Report (Product_Analysis_Report_Template.md)

This template is used to analyze product operational data, user feedback, and market performance, identify issues, and propose improvement suggestions. It includes product basic information, market background, user persona analysis, use case analysis, product analysis, competitor analysis, and strategic analysis using models such as Porter's Five Forces, McKinsey 7-S Model, PEST Analysis, and Business Model Canvas.
