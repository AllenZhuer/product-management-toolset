### Assessment Model Descriptions

#### RICE Scoring Model
RICE is a requirement prioritization assessment framework proposed by Intercom, containing four dimensions:
- Reach: How many users will this requirement affect
- Impact: The level of impact on each user
- Confidence: Confidence in the accuracy of the assessment
- Effort: The amount of work required to implement this requirement
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort

#### Kano Model
The Kano Model is a product requirement classification model proposed by Noriaki Kano, categorizing requirements into three types:
- Must-have Requirements: Basic requirements that must be met, failure to meet them will cause user dissatisfaction
- Performance Requirements: Requirements where the level of fulfillment is proportional to user satisfaction
- Delighter Requirements: Unexpected features that can bring additional satisfaction
