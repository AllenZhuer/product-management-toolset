# Product Management Toolset

This repository contains a set of product management tools, including document templates, examples, and AI prompts, designed to help product managers improve their work efficiency.

Both Chinese and English versions are available to support international teams.

1. **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**: A comprehensive document that details product features, user experience, and technical requirements.
2. **Product Requirement Review**: Used to organize and record requirement review meetings.
3. **Product Analysis Report**: Used to analyze product operational data, user feedback, and market performance.
4. **Product Launch Introduction**: Used to introduce new products or new versions and their features.

For detailed information about each template, please refer to the [templates/README_EN.md](templates/README_EN.md) file.

## Usage Guide

1. **Choose the Appropriate Template**: Select the corresponding document template from the `templates/` directory based on your work requirements.

2. **Fill in the Content**: Follow the guidance in the template to fill in the relevant content. Content in `[square brackets]` must be replaced with actual information.

3. **Refer to Examples**: If needed, refer to the examples in the `examples/` directory for reference.

4. **Adjust the Structure**: Based on actual needs, you can adjust the template structure, adding or removing certain content.

## Template Style Characteristics

These templates are inspired by enterprise documentation practices and have the following characteristics:

1. **Clear Structure**: Uses hierarchical numbering to organize content, making it easy to read and reference
2. **Highlighted Key Points**: Presents key information through tables, lists, and other formats to improve information retrieval efficiency
3. **Comprehensive Content**: Covers key information for all aspects of product management, ensuring the completeness of decision-making
4. **Practical Orientation**: Focuses on practical application scenarios and data support, avoiding vague descriptions

## Product Management Expert AI Prompts

The repository includes product management expert AI prompt files that can be used with AI assistants to get product management advice:

1. **Chinese Version** (`product_management_expert_prompt.md`): Helps the AI understand product management concepts and provide relevant assistance in Chinese.

2. **English Version** (`product_management_expert_prompt_EN.md`): The English equivalent, designed for international teams or English-speaking environments.

These prompts are structured in the LangGPT format and include detailed instructions on product strategy planning, user needs discovery, prototype design, roadmap development, and more. They can be used with AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, or other LLM-based tools to get specialized product management guidance.

### How to Use the AI Prompts

1. Copy the content of the appropriate prompt file (Chinese or English version)
2. Paste it into your preferred AI assistant that supports the LangGPT format
3. Interact with the AI to get product management advice, frameworks, templates, and best practices
4. Use the built-in commands (prefixed with "/") to access specific frameworks, templates, examples, or checklists

## Best Practices for Product Management

1. **Document-Driven Development**: Use documents to drive the product development process, ensuring that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the product.

2. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Base product decisions on data analysis and user research, rather than personal preferences.

3. **User-Centered Design**: Always consider the user's needs and experiences when designing products.

4. **Agile Iteration**: Adopt an agile approach to product development, with regular iterations and feedback loops.

5. **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Foster collaboration between product, design, engineering, and other teams to ensure a cohesive product vision.
